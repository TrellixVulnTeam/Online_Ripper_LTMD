            <h1>Welcome to Song Ripper!</h1>
        </div>

        <br>

        <div>
            <p>
                Simply plug in a valid YouTube song or a <strong>public</strong> playlist link below and click
                <i>Submit</i> or enter to initiate the process. Before downloading the songs, you will be able to
                manipulate the downloaded mp3 files' metadata to your liking. When you have filled out
                the form for a file, click the <i>Download</i> button to receive a prompt to save the mp3
                locally.
            </p>
            <p>
                If applicable, move to the next song by clicking the <i>Next</i> button.
                When doing so, Song Ripper will delete the previous file on the server, meaning
                you will not be able to redownload it unless you process the song through Song Ripper as
                a separate link or through a new playlist. Please note, the <em>Album</em> field is
                how Song Ripper will be able to retrieve the album cover through Spotify's open API.
                By taking advantage of the <i>Find Albums</i> search feature, simply providing an
                artist name will call Song Ripper to retrieve a list of albums from Spotify, which can then
                be copied into the <i>Album</i> field.
                <span class="caution"> By making sure your spelling is correct,
                Song Ripper will be able to locate the album by your specified input.</span> Song Ripper's
                features really shine when using YouTube playlists. By providing playlists' links, whenever new
                videos have been added, Song Ripper will remember previously downloaded songs by Song Ripper
                to prevent any redownloading. Song Ripper also allows for multiple playlists to be
                used and be remembered!
