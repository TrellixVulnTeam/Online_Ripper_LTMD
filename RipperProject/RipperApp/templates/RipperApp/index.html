            <h1>Welcome to Song Ripper!</h1>
        </div>

        <br>

        <div>
            <p>
                Simply plug in a valid YouTube song or a <strong>public</strong> playlist link below and click
                <i>Submit</i> or enter to initiate the process. Before downloading the songs, you will be able to
                manipulate the downloaded mp3 files' metadata to your liking. When you have filled out
                the form for a song, click the <i>Download</i> button to receive a prompt to save the mp3
                locally.
            </p>
            <p>
                If applicable, move to the next song by clicking the <i>Next</i> button.
                When doing so, Song Ripper will delete the previous file on the server, meaning
                you will not be able to redownload it unless you process the song through Song Ripper as
                a separate link or through a new playlist. Please note, the <em>Artist</em> and
                <em>Title</em> fields are how Song Ripper will be able to retrieve the album name
                and cover through Spotify's open API.<span class="caution"> The spelling in these fields
                are crucial for this process.</span> If the artist has no albums or the song is a single,
                Song Ripper will still be able to retrieve the album cover for the song.
            </p>
            <p>
                Song Ripper's features really shine when using YouTube playlists. By providing playlist
                links, whenever new videos have been added, Song Ripper will remember previously
                downloaded songs by Song Ripper to prevent any redownloading. Song Ripper also allows
                for multiple playlists to be used and be remembered! <span class="caution"> Please keep
                the amount of new songs or length of a new playlist low, 15 being the very max.</span>
                If a playlist of a larger length than 15 is initiated, the free storage on the backside
                of the server will be maxed out, resulting in the server being down until the downloads
                are deleted by a daily server task.
